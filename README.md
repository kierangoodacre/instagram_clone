# instagram_clone

Introduction

I was set the challenge of recreating our own instagram utilising Ruby on Rails. The Database used was PostgreSQL.

Technologies

|Languages |Frameworks|Testing  |
|----------|----------|---------|
|Ruby      |Rails     | Rspec   |
|CSS       |EJS       | Capybara|
|HTML      |jQuery    |         |
|          |Moustache |         |

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

This was my first solo Rails application which went well. Dealing with databases and learning the 'Rails way' was both fantastic and at times fustrating.


Improvements
------------
Improve on some of the styling. Also improve on some of the tes coverage, especially when adding the photos which I found difficult to test for.
